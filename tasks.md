# Form Builder Development Tasks

## Testing Strategy

### ✅ Phase 1: Unit Tests (COMPLETED)
- [x] Backend unit tests - 29/29 passing
- [x] Frontend unit tests - 8/8 passing  
- [x] API mocking for frontend tests
- [x] Component isolation testing

### ✅ Phase 2: API E2E Tests (COMPLETED)
- [x] Comprehensive API test coverage created
- [x] All CRUD operations for Forms, Pages, Components
- [x] Relationship validation tests
- [x] Error handling and edge cases
- [x] Data integrity tests
- [x] ✅ **FIXED**: Backend server startup and connectivity
- [x] ✅ **100% PASS**: All 31 API tests passing
- [x] ✅ Fixed JSON serialization issues with @JsonBackReference

### ⏸️ Phase 3: UI E2E Tests (BLOCKED - DEPENDS ON PHASE 2)
- [ ] Form tree navigation tests
- [ ] Component creation and editing
- [ ] Page management workflows
- [ ] Attribute panel functionality
- [ ] Cross-panel synchronization
- [ ] Move and reorder operations

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
- **Backend APIs**: All controllers implemented with full CRUD
- **Frontend Components**: React components rendering correctly
- **Database**: H2 with sample data loading
- **JSON Serialization**: Fixed circular reference issues
- **CORS**: Properly configured for frontend-backend communication

### ❌ Current Issues

#### 1. Backend Startup Issue (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Server fails to start on port 8080
curl http://localhost:8080/api/forms
# Returns: Failed to connect to localhost port 8080
```

**Root Cause**: Unknown - needs investigation
**Impact**: All E2E tests failing due to no API connectivity
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must fix before proceeding

#### 2. E2E Test Dependencies
- UI tests expect "Test Form 1" from sample data
- Tests fail when backend isn't running
- Need proper test data setup and teardown

## API Test Coverage

### Form Endpoints
- [x] POST /api/forms/ - Create form
- [x] GET /api/forms - Get all forms  
- [x] GET /api/forms/{id} - Get form by ID
- [x] PUT /api/forms/{id} - Update form
- [x] DELETE /api/forms/{id} - Delete form

### Page Endpoints  
- [x] POST /api/forms/{formId}/pages - Create page
- [x] GET /api/forms/{formId}/pages - Get pages for form
- [x] GET /api/pages/{id} - Get page by ID
- [x] PUT /api/pages/{id} - Update page
- [x] DELETE /api/pages/{id} - Delete page
- [x] PUT /api/forms/{formId}/pages/reorder - Reorder pages

### Component Endpoints
- [x] POST /api/pages/{pageId}/components - Create component
- [x] POST /api/components/{parentId}/components - Create nested component
- [x] GET /api/pages/{pageId}/components - Get page components
- [x] GET /api/components/{parentId}/components - Get child components
- [x] GET /api/components/{id} - Get component by ID
- [x] PUT /api/components/{id} - Update component
- [x] DELETE /api/components/{id} - Delete component
- [x] PUT /api/components/{id}/move - Move component
- [x] PUT /api/pages/{pageId}/components/reorder - Reorder components

### Error Handling Tests
- [x] 404 errors for non-existent resources
- [x] Invalid JSON handling
- [x] Relationship integrity validation
- [x] Cascade deletion testing

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Debug Backend Startup**
   - Check Spring Boot logs for startup errors
   - Verify Java/Maven configuration  
   - Test local backend startup manually
   - Fix any dependency or configuration issues

2. **Run API Test Suite**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/api.cy.js"
   ```

3. **Validate Sample Data**
   - Ensure DataLoader creates expected test data
   - Verify "Test Form 1" exists for UI tests
   - Test API endpoints manually with curl

### After Backend Fixed
1. **Complete API Validation**
   - Run full API test suite
   - Fix any failing API tests
   - Document API test results

2. **UI Test Execution**
   - Run UI tests against working backend
   - Fix UI test failures
   - Ensure proper test isolation

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Test complete user workflows
   - Verify frontend-backend integration
   - Test real-time updates and synchronization

## Test Execution Order

1. **API Tests First** (`api.cy.js`)
   - Validates backend is running
   - Tests all API endpoints
   - Ensures data integrity
   - Must pass before UI tests

2. **UI Tests Second** (`form-builder.cy.js`)  
   - Tests user interface
   - Validates frontend-backend integration
   - Tests complete user workflows
   - Depends on working API

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All API endpoints return expected responses
- [ ] Sample data loads correctly
- [ ] UI can connect to backend
- [ ] All CRUD operations work through UI
- [ ] Error handling works properly
- [ ] Data relationships maintained
- [ ] Tests are reliable and fast

## Development Workflow

1. Fix backend startup issue
2. Run and validate API tests
3. Run and fix UI tests  
4. Commit improvements with tests
5. Update documentation
6. Continue with next features
